                <p>This is another take on the Isa logo. I tried to come up with something that encapsulates her favorite interest - cycling. I turned the dot in the i into a bicycle tire, and made it appear as if her name is cycling up a mountain. This one took me about an hour in illustrator.  </p>

                <p>My girlfriend left for Italy yesterday, and I really miss her, so I decided to make a logo in her absense. This one took me about 45 minutes in illustrator. I could have gotten the lines a little bit better, but for all intensive purposes I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. </p>

                <p>I made this for my running club's first duel series race against BTC. This one took me about 3 hours total, mainly due to some initial mistakes. I also had to touch up the jbac logo in Illustrator so that I could give it a black outline. Not sure if they'll end up using it or not, but it feels good to start to create real world projects that people might actually use/benefit from.</p>

                <p>I was talking to a friend today about how he goes about designing flyers for the marketing company he works for, which inspired this design. It was created in photoshop, and took me about 45 minutes total. I could definitely improve upon the text coloring, as well as the placement and color of the logos, and, if I had more time, I would brighten up the image. Pumped with how this turned out for my first banner design in photoshop, though!   </p>

I initially started trying to design it in Photoshop, but realized that Illustrator was a better fit after a few tries. All in all this one took me about an hour.   </p>

Apparantly we weren't the only ones with this ridicuouls idea, and you can check out a hilarious video on this topic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBb9O-aW4zI">here.</a>. This design was done in illustrator using the text tool, as well as the type tool, and it only took me about 25 minutes.  </p>

                <p>Usually I edit photos with the application Acorn, but today I messed around with Photoshop to create this silly background. I created the beachball in illustrator (it could have been done a bit better), and then put it over top of this wavey background, and then added in the wavey text. All in all, this one took me about an hour and 15 minutes.  </p>

                <p>I've been needing simple backgrounds for use on some of the websites I develop, and usually I've just purchased them off of a stock website. This was my effort at creating my own abstract background, which emulates another background that I found on shutterstock. This one took me about 30 minutes in illustrator, and I used the elipse tool, the color fill, and the curvature tool. </p>

I spent about an hour and a fifteen minutes going over youtube tutorials on how to do this, and then I quickly made this design in about 20 minutes. Still nothing incredibly good looking, but I do feel like I'm getting better at this every day :) </p>

                <p>Today, I tried to make a spaceship in illustrator, but failed miserably. Spent about 2 hours trying to put it together, and then decided that it's something that I'll have to come back to in the future. I then messed around with some various shapes, and then ended up designing this hipstery "W," which I guess stands for "What did I learn." I learned a little bit about how to use the paintbrush tool, as well as how to use the curvature tool, although it doesn't show at all in this logo. Or maybe the W just stands for "weird," or "warm," as it is currently 97 degrees outside today. Tomorrow is a new day.  </p>

                <p>I got the idea for this one from a logo I saw while at a bike race the other day. It was designed in illustrator, and took me about an hour and 45 minutes to create. It was surprisingly hard to do, and it's still not perfect at the moment, but is close enough for now. I used the type tool, the shape drawer tool to draw a number of rectangles, and then the curvature tool to blend in some of the shapes. For some reason it came out differently when I saved it as an svg and put it up on this website - I'll have to be cognizant of that next time I design something with so many different layers.</p>

I've started noticing all of the logo's around me more and more, and realized that, it's usually the case that the simpler the logo, the better. Today I tried to make one for a made up company that was as simple as possible, and I also wanted to produce the first design that came into my head. This started with three bars, which I then played around with, and then stacked on top of one another. Nothing crazy, but I do feel like I'm gradually starting to become more efficient at this whole design thing, which gives me the feels.  </p>

I wanted to start redesigning my portfolio website, so I spent some time today creating a new logo for my portfolio page. This one was designed using illustrator, and it only took me about an hour. It's pretty simple, as I just used the American Typewriter font, and messed around with the color gradient. I imagine that I'll update it at some point in the near future, but I'm pretty happy with it's simplicity for now. </p>

Not incredibly happy with how this one turned out, but I did manage to learn a decent amount along the way. Learned that, just like coding, it's a much better idea to have a concept in mind before starting to create it in illlustrator. Between watching videos, as well as researching and messing around in illustrator, this one took me about 5 hours. </p>

                <h4>May 24, 2016</h4>
                <p>I created this logo in illustrator, and, from start to finish, it took me about 5 hours. I started out by googling "best way to learn illustrator," and stumbled upon the <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/illustrator-foundations" target="_blank"> Team Treehouse tutorial</a>. After watching the intro videos, as well as the "Create an Icon" videos, I took a stab at making my own icon, and ended up creating these mountains. Nothing crazy, but this was a lot of fun! </p>
